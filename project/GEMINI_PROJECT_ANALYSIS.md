## Project Analysis

### Task: Implement dynamic location behavior in `edit.blade.php`

**Date:** 2025-07-02 10:30:00

**Description:** Modified `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/edit.blade.php` to replicate the dynamic behavior of `provinsi_id` and `kabupaten_id` dropdowns, including GeoJSON triggering and the clearing/re-initialization of location inputs, as seen in `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/create.blade.php`. This involved updating the JavaScript section to include relevant functions for Select2 initialization, dynamic location row management, and map marker handling.

### Task: Fix preview button and double location row issue in `edit.blade.php`

**Date:** 2025-07-02 10:45:00

**Description:**
- Removed redundant JavaScript code from `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/_google_map.blade.php` that was causing duplicate location rows to be added.
- Corrected the `collectFormData` function in `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/edit.blade.php` to properly retrieve text values from Select2 elements for accurate preview display.
- Added a conditional message in `displayPreview` to indicate when no locations have been added.
- Added console logs for debugging the preview functionality.
