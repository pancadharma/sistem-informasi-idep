### Task: Implement dynamic location behavior in `edit.blade.php`

**Date:** 2025-07-02 10:30:00

**Description:** Modified `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/edit.blade.php` to replicate the dynamic behavior of `provinsi_id` and `kabupaten_id` dropdowns, including GeoJSON triggering and the clearing/re-initialization of location inputs, as seen in `resources/views/tr/kegiatan/create.blade.php`. This involved updating the JavaScript section to include relevant functions for Select2 initialization, dynamic location row management, and map marker handling.
